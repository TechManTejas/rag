"""
A simple Streamlit interface to use the RAG system.

Steps:
- Allows user to upload a .txt file or use default data
- Takes user input from a text field
- Passes it through the RAG pipeline
- Displays the generated answer in the browser

Ideal for testing and quick prototyping using a web interface.
